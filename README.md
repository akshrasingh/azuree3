This repository contains code for an Azure chatbot that utilizes Azure Language Services' Custom Answering feature and Azure Bot Service for intelligent responses. The chatbot can be trained to understand specific user intents, providing a tailored conversational experience. To get started, ensure you have an Azure account, Bot Service instance, and Language Understanding resource. Clone the repository, set up environment variables, and train the custom answering model using the provided data in the language_services directory. Finally, deploy the chatbot to Azure Bot Service and test it using the Bot Framework Emulator during development. Contributions from the community are welcome .
